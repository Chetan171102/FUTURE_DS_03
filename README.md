🎓 Student Feedback Analysis using NLP
Analyzing feedback from college events to generate actionable insights using Natural Language Processing.

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes student feedback from workshops, tech fests, and cultural programs to uncover hidden insights using Natural Language Processing (NLP). The dataset contains both rating-based and open-ended responses. We evaluated overall satisfaction, identified key sentiment trends, and visualized results using advanced data visualizations — including bar charts, heatmaps, pie charts, and word clouds.

🎯 Objectives
Understand student sentiment toward different events.

Identify common praise and criticism patterns.

Recommend strategic improvements for future event planning.
